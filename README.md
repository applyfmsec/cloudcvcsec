# About `cloudcvcsec`
`cloudcvcsec` is a library and toolkit for formally analyzing security policies in cloud/API systems using Python. It is a rewrite of [cloudz3sec](https://github.com/applyfmsec/cloudz3sec) using [cvc5](https://cvc5.github.io/). It takes influence from a number of related projects, such as the [Z3 Firewall Checker](https://github.com/Z3Prover/FirewallChecker).

## Background
Cloud/API systems are commonly secured through the use of security *policies* -- rules governing the set of  actions that agents (users, services, etc) are authorized to take within the system. For example, AWS uses IAM Policies; Kubernetes provides pod security policies, network policies, RBAC, etc. 

Within this context, a common question arises: given two sets of security policies, `P` and `Q`, are the rules generated by `P` and `Q` equivalent, or is one set strictly more permissive than the other? A particular common case is to let `P` be some existing policy set and let `Q` be a policy set that includes a security vulnerability. In this case, determining that `P` is equivalent to `Q` (or even just that `P=>Q`) establishes that the existing policy set contains a vulnerability. These are the types of questions `cloudcvcsec` tries to help answer.

# Using `cloudcvcsec`
There are multiple ways to use `cloudcvcsec`. The easiest way to get started is to use the `BasicCloudPolicy` and associated `BasicCloudPolicyManager` from the `cloud` module. This is a good approach for getting a quick sense for what `cloudcvcsec` is about. But keep in mind that the `BasicCloudPolicy` type is just one example of the kind of policy you can define.

## Using `BasicCloudPolicy`
The `cloudcvcsec` library includes a `BasicCloudPolicy` type that can be used directly for analyzing policy sets. A `BasicCloudPolicy` consists of the following components:

* `Principal` - an identity in the cloud system to which the policy applies.
* `Resource` - an object in the cloud system governed by the policy; for `BasicCloudPolicy`, a `resource` is a URL path on a service within a tenant at some site. (The `BasicCloudPolicy` is modeled after RESTful microservices running in different geographical locations and includes a concept of tenancy where tenants belong to *sites*; i.e., institutions and/or physical datacenters where services run).
* `Action` - an action being performed on a resource, in this case, an HTTP verb.
* `Decision` - either "allow" or "deny". 

Thus, policies allow or deny principals to take actions on specific resources. 

We can construct policies by constructing their individual components; i.e., by creating `Principal`, `Resource`, `Action` and `Decision` objects and passing them to the `BasicCloudPolicy` constructor. When creating any of the components, we use a two step process: first, we construct an instance of the object, passing in data that determines *all possible values* for the object. Then we call the instance's `set_data()` method to set the *specific value* for the policy.

For example, suppose our cloud system is deployed at two sites, `site_1` and `site_2`, and suppose it supports three tenants: `foo`, `bar` and `baz`. Suppose we have three services in our system: the `apps`, `files` and `jobs` services. Then the following policy grants user `jsmith` in the `foo` tenant at `site_1` authorization to make `GET` requests to the path `/apps/opensees` within the apps service:

```python
from cloudcvcsec.cvc_core import *
from cloudcvcsec.cvc_cloud import *

# define the list of all sites, tenants and services in our system --
sites = ['site_1', 'site_2']
tenants = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
services = ['apps', 'files', 'jobs']

# create the jsmith principal object --
# first, define the "universe"
jsmith = Principal(sites=sites, tenants=tenants, slv=slv)
# then call set_data to give the specific value
jsmith.set_data(site='site_1', tenant='foo', username='jsmith')

# similarly, define the apps Resource, the get Action, and the allow Decision --
apps = Resource(sites=sites, tenants=tenants, services=services, slv = slv)
apps.set_data(site='site_1', tenant='foo', service='apps', path='/apps/opensees')
get = Action(slv=slv)
get.set_data('GET')
allow = Decision('allow')

# finally, create the policy by putting all the components together --
policy = BasicCloudPolicy(principal=jsmith, resource=apps, action=get, decision=allow)
```

In addition to exact values for the components above, policies can include wild cards using the `*` character. For example, we could authorize `jsmith` for all HTTP methods instead of just `GET` with the following change:

```python
# construction of Principal, Resource, and Action same as before...
all_actions = Action(slv = slv)
all_actions.set_data('*')

policy = BasicCloudPolicy(principal=jsmith, resource=apps, action=all_actions, decision=allow)
```


The above approach of defining individual components one by one is verbose and tedious. The `BasicCloudPolicyManager` simplifies creating and working with `BasicCloudPolicy`'s, allowing strings to be passed in. For example, we can create the same policy above using the `policy_from_strs`, as follows:

```python
from cloudcvcsec.cvc_cloud import BasicCloudPolicyManager

m = BasicCloudPolicyManager(sites=['site_1', 'site_2'], tenants=['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], services=['apps', 'files', 'jobs'])

policy = m.policy_from_strs('site_1.foo.jsmith', 'site_1.foo.apps./apps/opensees', 'GET', 'allow')
```
In the above approach, we pass in the initial data defining the universe of all possible values for our components once to the `BasicCloudPolicyManager` constructor. This data includes the list of sites, tenants and services.

Then, we pass the values for the indivdual components for our policy as single strings. For example, for the principal, we pass the string `"site_1.foo.jsmith"`. The period (`.`) character separates the individual parts of the principal component (the `site`, the `tenant` and the `username`). 

## Analyzing the Equivalence of Policies
The main utility of `cloudcvcsec` is the ability to evaluate the equivalence of two policy sets. The `PolicyEquivalenceChecker` class from the core module provides this functionality. 

Continuing with the example above, note that because the `Action` class from the cloud module defines the allowable HTTP verbs to be GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, we can authorize a user for all HTTP methods for a single endpoint in two equivalent ways: either through 4 policies that individually grant authorization for each HTTP method, or via a single policy that uses a wildcard (`*`) to grant authorization to all HTTP methods at once. 

Here is how we might check that those two policy sets are equivalent using `cloudz3sec`:

```python
from cloudcvcsec.cvc_core import PolicyEquivalenceChecker
from cloudcvcsec.cvc_cloud import BasicCloudPolicy, BasicCloudPolicyManager

slv = cvc5.Solver()
# Set the logic
slv.setLogic("ALL")
# Produce models
slv.setOption("produce-models", "true")
# The option strings-exp is needed
slv.setOption("strings-exp", "true")
# Set output language to SMTLIB2
slv.setOption("output-language", "smt2")
slv.setOption("produce-unsat-cores", "true")

m = BasicCloudPolicyManager(sites=['site_1', 'site_2'], tenants=['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], services=['apps', 'files', 'jobs'])

p_1 = m.policy_from_strs('site_1.foo.jsmith', 'site_1.foo.apps./apps/opensees', 'GET', 'allow', slv)
p_2 = m.policy_from_strs('site_1.foo.jsmith', 'site_1.foo.apps./apps/opensees', 'POST', 'allow', slv)
p_3 = m.policy_from_strs('site_1.foo.jsmith', 'site_1.foo.apps./apps/opensees', 'PUT', 'allow', slv)
p_4 = m.policy_from_strs('site_1.foo.jsmith', 'site_1.foo.apps./apps/opensees', 'DELETE', 'allow', slv)
# first policy set, p
p = [p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]

q_1 = m.policy_from_strs('site_1.foo.jsmith', 'site_1.foo.apps./apps/opensees', '*', 'allow', slv)
# second, equivalent policy set, q
q = [q_1]

# a policy checker
ch = PolicyEquivalenceChecker(policy_type=BasicCloudPolicy, policy_set_p=p, policy_set_q=q, slv=slv)

ch.p_implies_q()
# output: "proved"

ch.q_implies_p()
# output: "proved"
```
The calls to `ch.p_implies_q()` and `ch.q_implies_p()` are wrappers around the `z3.prove()` function and print "proved" if `z3` can prove the statement is true, and will print a counter example if one is found.

For example, if we leave out one of the policies (policy `p_4`, say) from the `p` set, the call to `ch.q_implies_p()` will find a counter example:

```python
# ...
# above definitions of p_1 through ,p_4 and q the same...

# leave out the p_4 policy:
p = [p_1, p_2, p_3]

ch = PolicyEquivalenceChecker(policy_type=BasicCloudPolicy, policy_set_p=p, policy_set_q=q)

# this is still true, as p is strictly less permissive than q
ch.p_implies_q()
# output: "proved"

ch.q_implies_p()
# output: 
  # counterexample
  # [action = "DELETE",
  #  resource = "site_1.foo.apps./apps/opensees",
  #  principal = "site_1.foo.jsmith"]
```
Of course, in the above simple cases it is obvious whether the policies sets are equivalent, but the power of `cloudz3sec` comes from the ability to analyze policy sets where equivalence is not easy to determine manually. 

## Creating Custom Policy Types
"But my cloud API includes the PATCH method!" you exclaim. No problem! `cloudcvcsec` is designed to provide reusable components you can use to build your own security policy types representing the policies of your application. There are two types of building blocks provided by `cloudz3sec` that can be used for defining your own policy types: types where the underlying data are strings, and types where the underlying data are bit vectors. 

### String Types
`cloudcvcsec` currently provides 3 different base types for working with string data in security policies: `StringRe`, `StringEnumRe`, and `StringTupleRe`. All three descend from the base class `BaseRe` and allow for policies with wildcard (`*`) characters by utilizing regular expression constraints over the theory of strings. 

### The `StringEnumRe` Type
The `core.StringEnumRe` type can be used for strings that can take a fixed, finite set of values. The `cloud.Action` type, representing an HTTP verb is a good example of a `StringEnumRe` because instances of the type can only take on one of the following values: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or *. In general, `StringEnumRe` values cannot contain a wildcard with other characters; e.g., `P*` is not a valid `Action` value.

To create a new type based on `StringEnumRe`, simply descend from it and specify the allowable `values` for the new type:

```python
class ExampleStringEnum(cvc_core.StringEnumRe, slv:cvc5.Solver):
    def __init__(self):
        # your values here...
        values = ['value_1', 'value_2', 'value_3']
        super().__init__(values, slv)
```

### The `StringRe` Type
The `core.StringRe` type can be used for strings that can take arbitrary values from a specified character set. A username in a cloud system is an example of something we might model with a `StringRe` type, if we do not consider the list of usernames in our system to be a fixed, finite list (otherwise, `StringEnumRe` would be a better choice). Unlike `StringEnumRe`, a `StringRe` value can contain wildcard characters with other characters.

To create a type based on `StringRe`, one only needs to specify the character set:

```python
class ExampleIdentifierType(cvc_core.StringRe, slv:cvc5.Solver):
    def __init__(self, slv):
        # your charset here ...
        super().__init__(charset=set('abcd0123456789'), slv = slv)
```
The `cloud` module makes use of `StringRe` for usernames as well as (POSIX) paths on a file system.

### The `StringTupleRe` Type
The `core.StringTupleRe` type is useful for types that are really the composition of multiple `StringRe` and/or `StringEnumRe` types that should be thought of individually for the purposes of wildcard matching, but should be thought of as a single value in the overall policy. 

We illustrate the concept using the example of a principal (a user identity) in a multi-tenant cloud system. In such
a system, every user belongs to some tenant, and it is typical to represent an end-user identity as a username together with a tenant id. For example, for the `jsmith` user in the `foo` tenant, we might write the principal as `jsmith.foo` (or `jsmith@foo`, etc). For security policies in such a system that authorize principal(s) for one or more resources/actions, it is important to match the entire principal (user and tenant). For example, a security policy that authorizes `jsmith.bar` (`jsmith` in the `bar` tenant) for some resources has no bearing on the `jsmith.foo` user.
However, with wildcard characters, we want the wildcard to apply to only one component of the principal. For example, `*.foo` would be all users in the foo tenant, while `jsmith*.foo` would be all users in the foo tenant whose username starts with `jsmith`. 

We can create new types based on the StringTupleRe class by 
specifying a `fields` attribute to the construct. The `fields` attribute is a list of dictionaries, where each 
dictionary provides the following keys:

* `name: str` - the name of the field.
* `type: type` - the type of the field (e.g., `StringRe`, `StringEnumRe`).
* `kwargs: dict` - dictionary of keyword arguments to provide to the constructor of the field. For example, for `StringRe` fields, we should provide the `charset` argument and for `StringEnumRe` fields, we should provide the `values` argument.

As an example, here is how we might define our Principal type described above:
```python
from cloudz3sec import core

class Principal(core.StringTupleRe):

    def __init__(self, slv: cvc5.Solver) -> None:
        self.tenants = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
        fields = [
            {'name': 'tenant', 'type': core.StringEnumRe, 'kwargs': {'values': tenants, 'slv':slv}},
            {'name': 'username', 'type': core.StringRe, 'kwargs': {'charset': ALPHANUM_SET,'slv':slv }}
        ]
        super().__init__(fields, slv)
```

## Implementation and Contributing New Types
This section describes the implementation of the main classes in the core module, including the `BaseRe` class and its children classes that support the string types, as well as the `BasePolicy` and `PolicyEquivalenceChecker` classes. The goal of this section is to explain the ways in which `cloudcvcsec` depends on `cvc` and what is required to implement new (base) types in the core module.
